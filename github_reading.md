## Github Tricks
* Fuzzy file finder üîé
GitHub has a fuzzy file finder. 
Press <kbd>t</kbd> in any repository to access it and start typing the name of the file you want to find. 

* Keyboard tags
You can use `<kbd>` tags to make text appear like a button, which is slightly different from regular backticked text. 
It‚Äôs perfect for documenting things like keyboard shortcuts or game controls in your README(s)/wiki(s).
  
* Visualizing hex codes
Placing hex colors in backticks renders a tile in that color. It‚Äôs totally hexcellent!
GitHub contribution graph colors: `#C6E48B` `#7AC96F` `#249A3C` `#196127`

* Visualizing diffs üß°üíö
You can visualize a diff using backticks and diff which highlights lines red or green as appropriate.

```diff
10 PRINT ‚ÄúBASIC IS COOL‚Äù
- 20 GOTO 11
+ 20 GOTO 10
```  

if you add the language after the opening three backticks, the code is syntax highlighted accordingly.
